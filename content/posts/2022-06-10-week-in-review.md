So this is the humble start. I plan to write more + get some photos in here, but let's take baby steps. Idea to start blogging and start with links got highly inspired by great weekly review [Christof Damian](https://christof.damian.net/) is doing (with whom I have a pleasure to work with).

- My sister in law with her husband went off to Canada. They plan to travel across it on… bikes. Not motorbikes, as most (me?) civilized people would do - on regular, old fashioned, ecological bikes. They’re about to travel over 11,5k km in circa 4 months. They’ve started [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rudy.n.lok/) and [blog](https://rudy-n-lok.pl), you can read it in Polish or just look at photos
  - on a sidenote Lufthansa delivered **only one** of their bikes 48h after they've landed in Canada. Good job Lufthansa, we're proud of you.
  - same Lufthansa, which is [going to charge you (€25/$35) for seat selection if you're in Economy class](https://simpleflying.com/lufthansa-economy-light-seat-fee/)
- [Those new MacBook Airs…](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-m2/) god damn it, I don’t get it how Apple is doing it - I have enough laptops, but I still want this new one in midnight (blackish) color. Even though it’s crazy expensive (but there is no surprise in here)
- I’ve (re) started learning Elixir, some useful resources I’m using (and can only recommend) are:
  - [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir) - great, well aligned coding exercises.
  - [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - I really love their stories and riddles, but they tend to be quite time consuming. But in my opinion nothing teaches about language API as good as those.
  - [Elixir for programmers](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers-2) -this one is more about Elixir and Erlang, less about the API. But it's well designed, teaches about pattern matching, arity, OTP, basics of distributed services.
- [Dwarf Fortress](https://www.kitfoxgames.com/sendy/w/PjLUMcR8c67NlCEI4ruCLA/v763r5W81UUq567qGrvqMoZg/wEYCyTRE9HwQjDLPGvIBzg) seem to be on its finish line - I really can’t wait to get my hands on this game -
- (d&d) [An Ogre and His Cake](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/245793/An-Ogre-and-His-Cake--Digital) was a nice adventure to run for my kids. I've also ordered few archival adventures from [dndadventureclub.com](https://dndadventureclub.com) (and started a subscription), we'll see how this will go.
- [European Parliament votes to ban combustion engine cars from 2035](https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-votes-to-ban-combustion-engine-cars-from-2035/). This is a good move, but beside car makers and regular people shifting their minds, we still need infrastructure to hold it. Imagine everyone with car occupying gas distributor for ~1h - it's not scalable. Beside more charging stations, we need better batteries / charging tech. But one question remains - where from will we get all the power in situation, where during summer we're on the edge of hitting blackout (because of air conditioners)?

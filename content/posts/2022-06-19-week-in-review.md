I forgot it's not that easy to keep up with some periodic commitment. But given my history with running or any other type of exercises, I should already know what to expect. Nonetheless, with some delay, he it is.

- If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
A long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists - this video shows how sunscreen works. Worth 3 minutes of your time - https://youtu.be/o9BqrSAHbTc 
- [How to think clearly](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) - because thinking (clearly) is much more difficult, that one would expect. And I got the feelting that it slowly becomes the lost art. 
- [dooit](https://github.com/kraanzu/dooit) - A todo app for your terminal. One of many, but this one looks really great
- I love such apps, eg I use [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) as part of mine daily workflow
- (d&d) [The Night of the Rise](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/197033/The-Night-of-the-Rise--Adventure) is a nice, "different" adventure to plan as a one-shot, when you (or your players) need something different than usual dungeon crawl. I'd love to run more adventures like this one. 
- [Hundreds of SpaceX employees signed letter denouncing Elon Muskâ€™s behavior](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172913/spacex-complaint-letter-firing-elon-musk) it must be super difficult to work on history-changing product (which SpaceX definitelly is) under leadership of a guy, that can be... difficult to accept. Beside their non-existing work-life balance, I think this will soon lead to sound ground-braking changes that will alter company (and for sure Tesla) for ever.

It turns out, that I'll will do hell lot of writing in weeks to come. So this is, what I'm focusing on now

- [Writing for Engineers](https://www.heinrichhartmann.com/posts/writing/) - this is great summary about writing in tech companies. At the end you can find few recommendations, eg. "Leverage small writing tasks as exercise" - and I find it super important. Email should be well strucutres, support ticket should well describe the problem to avoid confusion and bring understanding. And Slack messages are much better when though-though - at least I have this ugly habbit of writing many short messages, that might get hard to understand.
- [Technical Writing  |  Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) - even google teaches about writing. If they've prepared their own course, it means how important this actually is.
- [Blogging for busy programmers](https://products.arkency.com/blogging/) - it's worthwhile mentioning that my old friends onec wrote a decent book about blogging as a developer.
- [The productivity tax you pay for context switching](https://async.twist.com/context-switching/) - I'm still struggling with that. For now I try to be very aware when I switch between tasks and I try to do [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) - and it helped me a lot during last week.

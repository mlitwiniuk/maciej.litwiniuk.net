Hi, I'm Maciej. I've co-founded and bootstrapped quite successful (or at least I like to think so) [software house](https://prograils.com). I've also tried (and failed) to launch a startup (or two) to cross it out from my checklist and learn what happens after pressing the magical "Launch" button. 

Recently I've closed above-mentioned consultancy and joined [Jobandtalent](https://jobandtalent.com) together with my team. Now I'm engineering director trying to both grow our Polish hub and spread the world about Jobandtalent's tech capabilities.
